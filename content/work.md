- Data from each particle forms a point cloud
- Dense regions with high transverse momentum are called _jets_
    - generated by exotic (heavy) particle from high energy collision
    - $\therefore$ jets provide window into small scale interactions
    - can use this to infer identity of initial particle, and history of decay
- Can express rich locality: point cloud $\xrightarrow{\text{link particles}}$
  graph structure
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) operate over linked neighbours

> This project seeks to define graph topologies and operations for HEP data.
> These will reflect the data's structure and enable high level interpretation.
> Models developed will identify novel particles,
> provide insight into their interactions, and decay history.
