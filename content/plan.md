- Explore techniques to improve efficiency, such as
    1. apply $k$-nearest neighbours
    2. graph coarsening
    3. incorporating graph convolution filters
- Encode more physical properties into the graphs than momenta
- Define expressive techniques for whole graph embedding
    - useful for particle classification
    - _eg._ anonymous walk embeddings
- Reconstruct jet evolution, from high energy collision to final state
